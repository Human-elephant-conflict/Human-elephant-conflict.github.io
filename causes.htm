              <h2>Causes of Human-Elephant Conflict</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion have encroached on elephant habitats, reducing the space available for elephants to roam and forage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Human Encroachment:</strong> As human populations grow, settlements and infrastructure developments push into traditional elephant territories.</li>
                  <li><strong>Food Scarcity:</strong> Deforestation and changes in land use lead to a scarcity of natural food sources for elephants, driving them to raid crops in search of sustenance.</li>
                  <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Altered weather patterns affect the availability of water and food for elephants, increasing their reliance on human-dominated landscapes.</li>

                    <h3>Habitat Degradation and Elephant Migration</h3>
                    <p>Despite the creation of 11 nature reserves in China to protect Asian elephants, the quality of their habitats has deteriorated. Strict control over activities like logging and forest fires has led to dense forests, where the food sources for elephants, such as banana plants, have diminished. Additionally, improper land management has allowed invasive plant species to take over, reducing the variety of plants available for elephants. As a result, 62.4% of elephants have left these reserves in search of food, becoming long-term "wanderers."

                  <div class="cause-details">
                    <h3>Expansion of Economic Fields</h3>
                    <p>The rise in population and economic development in elephant habitats has resulted in large-scale land-use changes. Natural forests have been replaced by rubber and tea plantations, drastically shrinking the elephants' suitable habitats. With the loss of forest cover and the expansion of economic forests, elephants are forced into human agricultural lands, where they frequently forage. This leads to frequent contact with humans and escalating conflict.

                      <h3>Infrastructure Development</h3>
                      <p>
                      The construction of highways, dams, and roads has fragmented elephant habitats, creating isolated "ecological islands" where elephants struggle to migrate and interact with other herds. For instance, elephants affected by the Lancang River dam can no longer return to their original habitats, becoming frequent "culprits" in human-elephant conflicts as they wander between fragmented areas.                      </p>

                      <h3>Food Source Construction</h3>
                      <p>
                      In an attempt to reduce conflict, local governments have established food base areas to lure elephants away from villages. However, these efforts have made elephants more dependent on human-provided food, as crops like corn and sugarcane are easy and nutritious sources. This increased dependence on human activity leads to more time spent near villages and further intensifies human-elephant conflicts, as elephants shift from eating wild plants to selectively foraging on cultivated crops.                      </p>
