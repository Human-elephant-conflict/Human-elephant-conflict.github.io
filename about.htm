            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Talia, a student from Shanghai. During the summer of 10th grade, I came across the topic of the human-elephant conflict in Yunnan and conducted field research there. In Dashujiao Village, I learned about the difficulties faced by local residents coexisting with elephants, which inspired me to create this website to raise awareness of the issue.  As I mentioned on the solution page, this is a very complex issue. Although my ability is limited as an individual, I hope more people will pay attention to this problem and become aware of it so that new solutions may emerge.

            <h2>My Research</h2>
            <p>
                When I arrived at Dashujiao Village and saw the damage to the villagers' fields and houses, I hoped to find methods that directly prevent elephants from invading their properties. This led to the following two articles.             </p>

                    <h3>Electric Fences
                    </h3>
                    <p>This article analyzes the characteristics of electric fences and elephant behavior, concluding that the effectiveness of electric fences declines as elephants have more knowledge about the fences.

                    <p>This article introduces the local warning systems in Yunnan. While the system is effective, it cannot fundamentally resolve the conflict, serving only as a preventive measure.</p>

        <h2>Fundraising</h2>
            <p>
                During my field research, I also discovered that some elderly people, who were in poor health and had difficult financial situations, were threatened by the elephants invasion. As a result, I initiated a fundraising to purchase electric fences in the hope of reducing the threat elephants posed to their safety.            </p>

            <p>
                In the hopes of improving the economic situation of local tea farmers, we helped the farmers design a brand called "Yunnan Elephant Tea". With the unique culture behind the tea, it allows the farmers to sell more tea to sustain their life.
